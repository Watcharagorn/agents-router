# Installing CLI Subagents (for AI agents)

CLI Subagents is an MCP server with a plugin for Claude Code, Codex and Antigravity. It needs Python 3.11 or newer and has no dependencies.

1. Install the `csa` command:

   ```bash
   pipx install git+https://github.com/lunati228/CLI-Subagents
   ```

   Without pipx: `pip install --user git+https://github.com/lunati228/CLI-Subagents`, then make sure the Python scripts folder is on PATH. Check with `csa --version`.

2. Install the plugin into the installed host CLIs and register any extra account folders the user named:

   ```bash
   csa setup --dry-run --account <name>=<folder>
   csa setup --account <name>=<folder>
   ```

3. Offer the optional [delegation rules](docs/delegation.md) template. It tells the main agent which models to use per tier and keeps work projects with the home vendor. Personal projects can try another CLI first, with helper limits and a fallback to the home model when there is no room.

   Ask whether the user wants it and which home and try-first models they want for each tier. If they agree, preview with `csa rules --show` and their values, then install. Otherwise skip it. For example:

   ```bash
   csa rules --install --target claude --home-high "Opus 5.5" --try-low "Gemini 3.8 Flash high" --try-medium "Sol 6.1 high"
   ```

   Use their host and models. Add `--work-folder` for each work folder they want listed. Nothing installs these rules without `--install`.

4. Tell the user the "Still needed from you" items it prints (browser logins, restarting the CLI).

5. Check with `csa doctor`. To update later, run `csa update`.

For an MCP client without a plugin system (Cline, Cursor and others), add a stdio server instead of step 2:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "cli-subagents": { "command": "csa", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

Then copy `skills/cli-subagents/SKILL.md` into the client's rules so the agent knows how to use the tools. The full steps and the manual commands per host are in the README's "For AI agents" section and in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
